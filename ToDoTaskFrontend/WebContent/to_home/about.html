<b>A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit.
 Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. 
 </b>

Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. 
 Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid
  assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure 
  liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of 
  capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.
